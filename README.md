## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out my Github. 
My name is Steven Dunne(He/Him) and I began seriously persuing a career in coding in November 2022 when I was blessed with an opportunity for a spot on a Department of Education funded bootcamp with HyperionDev.

## Hyperion
The Hyperion Bootcamp began is November 2022 and I finished on 14th Feb 2023 with an average grade of 98% through 52 assignments.
I'm extremely proud of this achievement and self-driven growth and I couldn't be more excited to begin this journey with new knowledge thanks to Hyperion.
